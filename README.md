- 👋 Hi, I’m @SamyBenn
- 👀 I’m interested in Rain
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to control weather
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on evil scientist plans
- 📫 How to reach me : thou shall ring a small silver bell 3 times with the right hand during the entire duration of a thuderstorm while holding 3 fresh cherries in the left hand that are still connected.
Afterwards, dry thineself quickly and consume the cherries whole, proceede by slaying thine strongest and healthiest sheep and skinning it. Feed thineself, thine family and thine neighbours equal portions that sall fill a man for a day.
finalise the summon by storing the remaining meat properly in salt and I shall appear. In the advent thou haven't enough to feed all or none remains, thou shall stay thine second strongest sheep.
